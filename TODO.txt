TODO: Save info box uses wrong colon for playtime. Are all colons used in GSC the tiny ones (No, Options menu uses the fat colons)?

TODO: Save info box updates playtime because I am forced to reshow it between Yes/No boxes.
Save playtime in variable and rewrite function to use it?

TODO: Down arrow in textbox needs to be spawned with a sprite. The Emerald behavior needs to print it offscreen or not at all.

TODO: Right-facing arrow cursor (used in start menu, Yes/No boxes, etc.) turns white in Crystal when A is pressed to select something.
Need to replicate this behavior.

TODO: BUG: Text from the option selections themselves (FAST, LR, etc.) overwrite the main choices. Need to figure out CpuCopy32 and only print the top 8 pixels of the choices to prevent the clipping.

TODO: Update Options menu selections to Crystal equivalents when flags are figured out. Make the Menu Account option actually work for the start menu.

TODO: Black out the Options menu background; and decide if SGB borders are a thing and implement them.
