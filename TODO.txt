TODO: Save info box uses wrong colon for playtime. Are all colons used in GSC the tiny ones (No, Options menu uses the fat colons)?

TODO: Save info box updates playtime because I am forced to reshow it between Yes/No boxes.
Save playtime in variable and rewrite function to use it?

TODO: Right-facing arrow cursor (used in start menu, Yes/No boxes, etc.) turns white in Crystal when A is pressed to select something.
Need to replicate this behavior.

TODO: Update Options menu selections to Crystal equivalents when flags are figured out. Make the Menu Account option actually work for the start menu.

TODO: Black out the Options menu background; and decide if SGB borders are a thing and implement them.

TODO: Import the remaining tilesets (Battle Tower Outside, Cave, Dark Cave, Forest, Ice Path, Park, Port, Radio Tower, Ruins of Alph, and possibly PokeCom Center).

TODO: Fix Linking. Relevant files are not yet decompiled. (From pokeruby) Will need to mess with SetCableClubWarp to get the warps set correctly before entering the link rooms. Gold & Kris don't show in link room when linking to Emerald (showing Brendan and May instead), OWs are aligned like Emerald, a copy of the link partner appears below the player sprites (using wrong base OAM?), and all player OW palettes are messed up. Can trade, at least. There doesn't appear to be logic for linking to FRLG, so field_specials.c may not be relevant for Emerald. Check CreateLinkPlayerSprite in overworld.c.
